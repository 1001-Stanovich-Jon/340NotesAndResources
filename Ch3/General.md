# Assumptions

1. Steady State Sinusoidal Conditions
2. Windings have 0 resistance, so power loss is 0
3. Core premiability is infinite (no reluctance) - allows us to use N1I1 = N2I2
4. No leakage flux (i.e. all configed to core and windings)
5. No core losses

Important equations:


For this circuit:





we have the following equations
